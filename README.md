# CS601 Web Application Development Assignment 1: Biography 

## Requirements

* Using only HTML 5 (no CSS, JavaScript, or other languages):
  * You will create a three (3) page website incorporating what you have learned
    about HTML 5 this week. The focus of the site should be about you. Think of this
    as a biography that will grow into a larger project, a portfolio (term project). Your
    site can have an alternate topic/focus if approved in advance by your facilitator.

Here are the specific requirements:
1. You must have at least two (2) paragraphs of text based content on at
   least one page. 
   * Full paragraphs are 4-5 sentences in length.
2. You must provide at least one (1) external hyperlink to a publicly hosted
     website(s) on at least one page.
     * You can choose to link to your work, your hometown, hobbies,
     interests, etc.
3. You must use the new HTML5 structural elements on every page.
   * You can use the same image on every page, but if you do, that will
   only count as having one image on one page. Add an additional
   image(s) to the other pages to meet the requirement.
4. Create a consistent menu/navigation bar that is used on all pages and
   contain links to the other pages.
   * You may use a list for navigational/menu purposes. The list could
   then be styled with CSS as part of next weekâ€™s assignment.
   * You are encouraged to use HTML 5 video/audio elements, but you
   can alternatively embed a YouTube video if you desire.
5. Include one video or audio element on at least one page that successfully
   plays in Firefox.
   * You should be able to access all pages from any page of your site.
   *  This list should contain traditional list-type content
6. Include one table containing tabular data on at least one page.
7. Include at least one image on every page
   * Internal links to other pages of your site do not count towards this
   requirement.
